== Season planning

Training plans always aim towards a peak in the season. This may vary from athlete to athlete. However, in most cases, the peaks are so close together that it is still possible to train in a group. This will require compromises to be made.

Despite focusing on a season highlight, competitions still usually have to be contested. It is important to ensure that no intensive strength or speed training takes place in the last 3-4 days before the competition. In addition, you should make sure to eat foods rich in carbohydrates during the last three days before a competition.
