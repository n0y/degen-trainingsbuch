= Effects of destructive feedback

Destructive feedback negatively affects existing skills and the ability to learn new skills efficiently in several ways:

.Effect on the mental lexicon
. *New negative associations*: +
Terms such as "jump," "technique," "movement," and "training" now have negative connotations. e.g. "Avoiding" becomes associated with "failure," "embarrassment," and "inability."
. *Strong emotional markers*: +
Language such as "crazy chicken" is stored with an emotional charge.
Such terms can become trigger words that put the entire system into a state of shame, fear, or withdrawal.
. *Weakening of positive nodes*: +
Concepts previously rated positively (e.g. "Development," "Practice pays off") are overwritten or suppressed.

.Effect on movement representations (layer: body experience, motor schemata)
. *Disturbance of the sense of movement*:
Negative evaluation generates self-doubt: The athlete doubts their own perception ("I thought that felt good—apparently it was bad").
This weakens the coherence of motor representations.
. *Fragmentation*:
Instead of concentrating on processes (timing, power, rhythm), the athlete suddenly pays attention to external effects. This makes movements uneconomical, unstable, and alienated from the body schema.

.Effect on the implementation of new movement tasks
. *Reduced openness*:
.. New things are interpreted as potential dangers ("Will I be exposed again?")
.. Exploration is avoided – an important component of motor learning is blocked.
. *Convergence of cognitive resources*: +
Attention narrows to "How do I come across?" instead of "How does that feel?" This means that fewer resources are available for implicit learning and motor adaptation.
. *Reduced sense of self-efficacy*:
.. The core belief, "I can develop myself," is undermined.
.. New tasks tend to be met with avoidance behavior or ostensibly ironic distance (self-protection).

Negative, evaluative feedback has a profound effect on the mental lexicon and can, in the long term, paralyze motor skills, destabilize movement patterns, and
limit the ability to learn creatively and exploratively.
