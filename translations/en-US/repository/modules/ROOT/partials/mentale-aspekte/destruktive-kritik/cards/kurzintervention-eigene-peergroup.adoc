Emotional criticism from one's own training group (mockery, insults) usually weighs much heavier than feedback from outside. They threaten self-image just as much, but also social security—and thus the willingness to learn. However, trainers are present and can intervene directly.

Objectives of the intervention:

* Immediate emotional relief for the affected athlete
* Setting clear but not humiliating boundaries with the group
* Restoring dignity, freedom, and motivation to learn
* Reintegrating the group by refocusing – not by punishing

Address: clear body language, calm (not loud), look at the group (not the victim; signals protection)

You know, exercise looks different for everyone. Those who dare to do something here deserve respect—not comments.

Mistakes show courage. Those who laugh have not understood what this is all about.

That was unfair. You took a risk—that's impressive. I want you to do it again right now. And this time you're there for yourself, not for others.
____

After the repetition, a brief, focused observation helps ("Your timing was really brave just now. That's what counts.")

Alternative if repetition is not possible:

Short physical exercise: stand firmly, breathe twice consciously, tense up, relax

Objective:

* Overwrite mockery
* No one loses face
* Reintegration of those affected through joint exercise

Open exercise for everyone and focus on your own style:

Okay—same task again for everyone. Everyone has a try, and everyone tries it their own way, in a way that no one else does.
