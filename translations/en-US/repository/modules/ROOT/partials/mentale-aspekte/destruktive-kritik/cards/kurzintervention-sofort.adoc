Goals:

* Negative feedback + emotion ≠ reality
* → Decoupling + Embodiment + New Semantic Nodes + Repetition

Immediately after receiving inadvertently destructive criticism, it is important not to internalize the negative statement.

Address (calm, clear, direct):

NOTE: Works because the immediate semantic recoding interrupts the automatic anchoring in the mental lexicon. This creates distance from the comment (disidentification).

Goal: Overwrite emotion through movement (embodied reframing)

Sample exercise: "Back to your power"

* Stand with your feet apart.
* Swing your arms loosely.
* Inhale – arms up.
* Exhale – let your arms fall with momentum.
* Then stand in a strong posture for 3 seconds (e.g. "Power pose": chest out, head up).

.Once again, briefly: An example of a 30-second response to a derogatory comment:
. "Forget the chicken comment—that was unnecessary."
. Exercise: Arms up, exhale, power pose +
"Feel it: this is your energy—stay with yourself."
. "Your jump was courageous—let's now work on timing and direction."
