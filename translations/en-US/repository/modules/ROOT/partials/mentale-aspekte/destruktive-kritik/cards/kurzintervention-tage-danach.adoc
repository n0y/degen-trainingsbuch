Use when the destructive feedback occurred some time ago (a few days). It is then often already firmly established and may have already "grown" emotionally. Perhaps your self-image has already changed.

Goals:

* Capture or reinterpret the inner story that has formed after the feedback.
* Restoring the desire to move and openness.
* Make the athlete feel that they are not wrong, but that something in the environment was not right.

Approach: inviting, not pushy

Goal: Dissolve the fusion between evaluation and self-image, restore control.

Address: calm, direct, with specific details (if known)

Not everyone who is loud is right. And not every comment reflects reality. Perhaps what you heard says more about that person than it does about you.
____

Goal: new movement experience, focus on self-efficacy

Perform a short exercise that includes criticized elements (if known) or (in the case of general criticism) the athlete's key strength:

Let's do the evasive maneuvers—but in a way that feels good for you. Not how someone wants to see it. I only observe the timing, not the style.

Followed by feedback on self-efficacy:

Your rhythm is there—and that's what we'll build on.

Goal: Add useful metaphors to your mental lexicon, shape a positive self-image

Address: cheerful, inviting

____
What you do makes sense. You are currently developing new patterns. That often takes courage—and that's exactly what I see in you.
____

Or if the criticism contained a metaphor, it can be reinterpreted:

____
You're not a chicken. More like a bird of prey turning—sometimes a little shaky, then precise. But a little crazy in any case. And that's what it takes.
