== countermeasures

Of course, destructive feedback should generally be avoided. However, experience shows that it still happens time and again, either because a coach instinctively and spontaneously acts incorrectly (and, in the best case scenario, notices this themselves immediately), or because, for example, during courses, camps, or tournaments, there is contact with untrained coaches who mistakenly use destructive criticism as a training tool.

A number of measures are effective in cushioning negative effects. They can be learned in advance (resilience training) or applied retrospectively (intervention). The following are particularly effective:

* *Reframing*: Terms with negative connotations must be actively replaced with new semantic nodes or devalued. 
For example: "What was called 'crazy chicken' was perhaps an interesting solution of its own."
* *Trusting social contexts*: A safe space with supportive language ("I see you're on a roll," "Look what's improved") can override damaged nodes.
* *Metaphorical work*: New positive metaphors help to rebuild the mental lexicon: "Land like a cat" instead of "Don't flutter like a chicken."
* *Encourage self-reflection*: Questions such as "What did you feel?" and "What would you have done differently?" strengthen the connection to one's own body image and create a counterbalance to external devaluation.

Destructive feedback should always be avoided. It is considered one of the most common causes of reduced motivation, self-doubt, and performance blocks in sports.

. Nevertheless, practice shows that such feedback continues to occur—as a spontaneous emotional reaction, due to untrained communication, or through encounters with external trainers (e.g., in training courses, tournaments), who mistakenly believe that destructive feedback promotes performance.

Several compensatory strategies have proven effective in buffering or even reversing negative effects. These can be used both preventively (by building resilience) and reactively (as an intervention):

* *Reframing – semantic restructuring*:
Terms with negative connotations are replaced by new networks of meaning or devalued. 
Example: Instead of "crazy chicken" → "an unusual, creative solution of your own."
The goal is to recode the mental lexicon in order to break the emotionally negative association.

.
* *Creating socially safe contexts*:
Building trust through empathetic, validating language such as: +
_"I see that you're sticking with it."_ or _"Your landing was much more stable."_ +
Such statements strengthen self-image and counteract dysfunctional knots in the semantic network.

.
* *Metaphorical recoding*:
Positive, body-oriented images help to overwrite damaged movement representations. 
Example: Instead of "don't flutter like a chicken" → "land softly like a cat"

.
* *Self-reflection through targeted questions*:
Questions such as "What did you feel?" or "What could you have done differently?" activate the body schema and shift control back to the athlete. 
Goal: Strengthen agency and self-efficacy in order to put external evaluation into perspective.

These strategies combine linguistic-semantic reorganization with emotional reassurance and promote long-term resilience to unfavorable influences on motor learning.
