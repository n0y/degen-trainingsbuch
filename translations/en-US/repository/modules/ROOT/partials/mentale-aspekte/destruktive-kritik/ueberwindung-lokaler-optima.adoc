= Destructive criticism to overcome local minima and motor stability thresholds

In older motor learning theory, it was assumed that destructive feedback was a suitable means of overcoming so-called local optima—stable movement patterns that are efficient in the short term but suboptimal in the long term. The idea here was that only through harsh criticism and disruption could the athlete be "shaken out" and forced into new, more effective patterns.

This view is now largely outdated. It is true that targeted irritation of the existing motor system can be helpful in overcoming stability limits. However, destructive, negative emotional feedback often causes shame, insecurity, or feelings of embarrassment—factors that have been shown to inhibit cognitive processing and motor exploration behavior.

The following strategies have been empirically tested and promote variability, exploration, and recontextualization of movements—key principles for overcoming local minima:

* *Context change*:
Place movement instructions in unfamiliar settings, e.g.
_"Perform the movement with your eyes closed."_ or
_"Imagine you are moving underwater."_ +
This promotes sensory reorganization and decouples automated routines.

.
* *Alienation techniques*:
Intentionally slowing down or speeding up movement, or performing it under altered environmental conditions (e.g. unstable ground, change of rhythm). 
Goal: Opening up the sensorimotor solution space.
* *Metaphor change*:
Example: Instead of "explosive push-off" → "popping like a burst balloon" +
New semantic images help to reconnect movement representations and activate alternative motor solutions.

.
* *Semantic enrichment*:
For example. Question: "What would be the opposite of your movement?" +
Activates the mental lexicon and stimulates cognitive flexibility.
* *Temporary exaggeration/regression*:
For example. "Deliberately do it much too fast / too softly / too strongly – feel the extremes." +
Helps to perceive the limits of movement and promotes self-organization.

These techniques combine disruption without damage and variation without embarrassment—two central principles of modern training didactics that promote sustainable motor learning.
