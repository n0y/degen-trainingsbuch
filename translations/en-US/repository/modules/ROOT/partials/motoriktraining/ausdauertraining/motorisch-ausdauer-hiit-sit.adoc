The following training plan, based on

include::partial$gen/bibliography.adoc[tag=RKNGW]
(34), uses alternating high-intensity interval training and sprint interval training.

The "normal run" (no specification) in the unit refers to 95% of the speed of a 6-minute run, which is determined at the beginning of the multi-week unit. Depending on the equipment, speed or (better) heart rate can be used as a guideline.

The "sprint" units are always run at maximum possible speed.
