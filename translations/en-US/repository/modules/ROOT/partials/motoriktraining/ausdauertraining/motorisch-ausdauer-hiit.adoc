The following training plan, based on

include::partial$gen/bibliography.adoc[tag=EHIiS]
, implements high-intensity interval training with two sessions per week (less than 30 minutes per session) and has been used successfully with adults and schoolchildren (aged 12).

The "normal run" (no specification) in the unit refers to 90% of the speed of a 6-minute run, which is determined at the beginning of the 6-week unit. Depending on the equipment, speed or (better) heart rate can be used as a guideline. If heart rate is used, this also removes the pressure to perform, which can be demotivating, especially when starting endurance training.

The "sprint" units are always run at maximum possible speed.
