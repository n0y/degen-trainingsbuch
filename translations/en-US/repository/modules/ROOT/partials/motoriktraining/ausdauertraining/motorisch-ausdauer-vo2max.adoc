Maximum oxygen uptake capacity (VO2 max) is a decisive factor for endurance performance. It can be measured, for example, using the Cooper test, which involves running for 12 minutes to cover the maximum distance possible.

With this training plan, you can increase your VO2 max by about 10% in 12 weeks from an already good fitness level. If your fitness level is not yet very good, the increase can also be higher in percentage terms.

First, the current performance must be determined. To do this, the athlete runs for a maximum of 12 minutes and measures the distance: in this example, 3000m.

The following four training sessions are derived from the measured values:

|session |calculation |Example 3000m

|Sunday
|(measured distance * 4) in 56 min
|12 km in 56 minutes

|Tuesday
|Measured lap time = 400m * 720s / measured distance +
Time limit = measured lap time / 2 + 8s +

Run 200m within the time limit, then take a 90s break +
Repeat with break times of 75s, 60s, 45s, 30s, 15s +
 +
Repeat all until the time limit cannot be met.
a|according to Lap time = 400m*720s / 3000m = 96s +
Time limit = 96s/2 + 8s = 56s +

This training plan is always run for 8 to 12 weeks. He should then alternate with training plans for sprint interval training (or HIIT).
