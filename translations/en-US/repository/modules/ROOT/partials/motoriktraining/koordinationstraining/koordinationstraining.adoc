= coordination training

Coordination refers to

include::partial$gen/bibliography.adoc[tag=KFuKiS]
the orderly interaction of different parts and processes of a system toward an intended goal.

The scientific understanding of coordination skills is currently incomplete. There are gaps in research and empirically verified alternative approaches.

.

Nevertheless, some forms of coordination exercises are useful and show good results.

== Fundamentals of coordination training

It is problematic to consider coordination skills separately because they are hypothetical constructs that cannot be directly observed.

and always draws on a specific combination of several skills with different weightings

.

The viability of the approach to coordination skills is increasingly being questioned. This applies in particular to the concept of general, overarching coordination skills. The findings tend to indicate a high degree of skill specificity: training has a significant effect on performance in tasks that are part of the training, but the effects can hardly be transferred to other tasks (see, for example,

include::partial$gen/bibliography.adoc[tag=RbSBM]
and

include::partial$gen/bibliography.adoc[tag=HMSSvSe]
).

Nevertheless, general coordination training is often considered useful with the aim of maintaining non-sporting skills, counteracting training monotony, and maintaining confidence in problematic situations.

The following are considered to be shares in the training:

e.g., 5% for general coordination training and 10-15% for sport-specific coordination training.

In

include::partial$gen/bibliography.adoc[tag=KFuKiS]
shows that training general coordination skills and skill-related technique training are two ends of the same continuum. Technical training is therefore always sport-specific coordination training.

.

The main training method in skill-based coordination training is variable practice.

.

The variation methods of program, parameter, and condition variable practice described there show a clear similarity to differential learning.

== Specific coordination training

The rule of thumb is that the coordination requirements in training must always be higher than in the subsequent reproduction. In other words, more difficult exercises with a greater density of actions than in real-life situations.

The normal technical elements used in games and partner exercises provide a good basis for competitive fencing. In addition, there are always variable pressure conditions that ensure the desired coordination skills are developed.

== Neuroathletics training

Neuroathletics deals with the processes of the brain and nerves in the development of movement programs before an action is performed.

The focus is on training perception

* of the visual system (vision)
* of the vestibular system (balance)
* and the proprioceptive system (self-perception).

The basis for this is that the quality of perception and processing in the brain is decisive in determining whether the athlete's entire system can deliver maximum performance in a targeted manner. When problems arise in perception, the brain responds by reducing available performance in order to eliminate the risk of injury.

This processing can be optimized for all athletes. Deficits in this area can often be identified with the naked eye:

* The movements appear awkward.
* Actions are carried out hesitantly and cautiously.
* Movements appear inconsistent, are interrupted or stopped.
* Actions are taken cautiously; the athletes seem to lack confidence in their own abilities.
* The athletes turn away (e.g., during parries and counterattacks), crouch down, and pull one leg or their unarmed arm toward the center of their body.
