Parade riposte with precision requirement: body position

Note: the exercise can also be performed with any other simple action.

Partner exercise 1:1 on variable ground

Long benches, wall bars, soft floor mats

Create multiple training surfaces:

* Long benches on wall bars with varying inclines
* Upside-down long benches
* Soft floor mats, different thicknesses if possible

A and B face each other at medium distance:

* A shortens with a step forward and threatens B with the blade in line.
* B responds with a parade riposte.

The exercise is performed three times with a quart, sixth, or octave parade. Then the change takes place. Occasionally, the substrate is changed.

Before each set, the trainer gives B a new additional task, e.g.

. Small jump on the spot during the parade
. Starting position with rear knee on the floor
. During the riposte, bring your rear heel to your buttocks.
. Rear foot stretched backward in the air
. Starting position in lunge
. Unarmed hand on the floor
. Lift your front knee during the parade
. Leaning forward as far as possible
. Everything with an outstretched arm
. Keep a low profile during the parade, but make a big splash during the riposte.
. With legs stretched out, feet four feet apart
. Reach behind your head with your unarmed arm to touch your other shoulder.
. Lean back and relax at the parade
. Stamp your front foot when counterattacking
