Lesson length approx. x minutes.

.Purpose of the lesson
* Mensur behavior for combined attacks
* Observation of possible enemy reactions
* Situational execution of the cavitation

//-

.task
. Athlete moves freely on the track, coach follows and maintains medium distance, both in octave
. Trainer opens the Mensur
. As soon as a wide distance is reached, the athlete begins a direct attack to the chest with a jump forward/lunge.
. Trainer reacts with a high semicircle third parry/riposte
. Athlete dodges the parry (kavation) and strikes before the riposte reaches its target.

Select randomly from these tasks until the lesson length is reached.

* Variation in movement execution / spatial execution
** Different parades (with announcement), e.g., sixth, fourth, octave, prime
** Selection of parades (announcement of possibilities)
** Encountering new vulnerability: e.g., chest-thigh, foot-chest, hand-mask
* Variation in movement execution: speed
** Execution particularly fast, in slow motion
* Variation in movement execution: acceleration
** Increasing or slowing down movement
** Waiting for the parade
* Variation in sensory perception
** e.g., in semi-darkness, with light/dark background
* Variation Materials
** e.g., against unarmed trainer; with mini-épée; with glove
* movement execution
** Initial and final conditions
** spatial design
** spatial-temporal execution (speed)
** dynamic execution (acceleration)
** temporal execution (rhythm)
** scope
** duration
* Sensory perceptions (limitations, amplification)
* Materials, equipment
* Subsoil, terrain
* Framework conditions, rules
