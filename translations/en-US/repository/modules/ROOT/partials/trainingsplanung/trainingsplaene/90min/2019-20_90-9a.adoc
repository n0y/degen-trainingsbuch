a|==== Warming up with benches I

The fencers stand in two groups half a volleyball court away from the wall bars.

In front of them (in the way) are two benches, the first (closer one) turned upside down.

The first person in each case has a mask in their hand.

.Task:
* The FIRST one is starting
* under the first bench
* over the second bench
* and hangs the mask on the lowest rung
* The SECOND one is the same, but the mask hangs one rung higher.

The team whose mask is the first to hang at the top wins.

The fencers stand in a row in front of three benches placed one behind the other. After each time they get over the benches, they run back sideways and rejoin the line at the back.

Possible ways to overcome this include:

* Crawling across the benches
* Pull-ups in the prone position
* Two-legged squat jumps
* One-legged jump (stand on left leg, jump up, 2x forward, land on right leg)

a|=== footwork

Always perform the following sequence of steps:

* Forward:
** three steps ahead
** two back
** two before
** Failure / Follow-up
* Backwards:
** three steps back
** two before
** two back
** Failure / Position

with the following variants (each only once):

* Front foot turned 90° inward (both feet parallel)
* way down below, almost at duck level
* with circling arms
* inclined (entire position rotated 45° inward)
* with knees straight and upper body leaning far back
* leaning as far forward as possible
* with the front foot in the air for as long as possible
* without lifting your feet
* with swaying upper body (up and down) and arms
* with zigzag (change of direction with every step)
* with weight on the front foot and limping with the back foot
* Squat down every other step and hold your arms above your head.
* With each movement: clap alternately in front of and behind the body.
* in a step position (back foot pointing forward) and with the upper body completely turned
* Upper body goes first, then the feet follow

a|=== Fencing with fencing task

The hall side is the attacker.

.task
* Attacker must score a hit
* Defender should do something funny, e.g.:
** jump wildly to the right and left
** wave a gun around
** run away just before the meeting
** squat down
** constantly hitting the opponent's weapon
** stand with the weapon above your head
** hop on one leg
* Then swap until everyone has attacked five times.

Once everyone has done this against two others, normal free fencing begins.
